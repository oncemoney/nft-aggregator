## Unreleased

### Feature: Include Block in Query Responses

Responses to GraphQL queries now include the block at which the query was
executed. The response now contains an `extensions` field of the following
form:

```json
{
  "data": "...",
  "extensions": {
    "subgraph": {
      "blocks": {
        "ethereum/mainnet": {
          "hash": "ea3bc37eb909f29c897d7a3fe3de30abd86baa58619403941e14a9797063a479",
          "number": 9892879
        }
      },
      "id": "QmZo35amfokYndPeuRd91bSzF6EusfBKMuDQCvaq25FVUX"
    }
  }
}
```

The key in the `blocks` object indicate the Ethereum network that the
subgraph indexes, such as `ethereum/mainnet` or `ethereum/kovan`. What
exactly gets reported has `hash` and `number` depends on the query:

- for time-travel queries with a block constraint of the form `block: {
hash: "deadbeef" }`, that hash and the number of the corresponding block
will appear in the response
- for time-travel queries with a block constraint of the form `block: {
number: 123456 }`, the `hash` will be all zeroes, and the number will be
the number given in the query
- for queries without any block constraint, the query will be run against
  the latest block that subgraph has processed, the hash and number of that
  block will be reported in the response

### Misc

- Fix loading more than 200 dynamic data sources (#1596).
- Log warnings after 10 successive failed `eth_call` requests. This makes
  it more visible when graph-node is not operating against an Ethereum
  archive node (#1606).
- Log all GraphQL and SQL queries performed by a node, controlled through
  the `GRAPH_LOG_QUERY_TIMING` [environment
  variable](docs/environment-variables.md) (#1595).
- Add integration test for handling Ganache reverts (#1590).
- Don't return `__typename` to mappings (#1629).
- Normalize `BigDecimal` values, limit `BigDecimal` exponent (#1640).
- Strip nulls from strings (#1656).
- Less expensive block polling (#1645).

## 0.18.0

**NOTE: JSONB storage is deprecated and will be removed in the next release.
This only affects subgraphs that were deployed with a graph-node version
before 0.16. Starting with this version, graph-node will print a warning for
any subgraph that uses JSONB storage when that subgraph starts syncing. Please
check your logs for this warning. You can remove the warning by redeploying
the subgraph.**

### Feature: Fulltext Search (#1521)

A frequently requested feature has been support for more advanced text-based
search, e.g. to power search fields in dApps. This release introduces a
`@fulltext` directive on a new, reserved `_Schema_` type to define fulltext
search APIs that can then be used in queries. The example below shows how
such an API can be defined in the subgraph schema:

```graphql
type _Schema_
  @fulltext(
    name: "artistSearch"
    language: en
    algorithm: rank
    include: [
      {
        entity: "Artist"
        fields: [
          { name: "name" }
          { name: "bio" }
          { name: "genre" }
          { name: "promoCopy" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  )
```

This will add a special database column for `Artist` entities that can be
used for fulltext search queries across all included entity fields, based on
the `tsvector` and `tsquery` features provided by Postgres.

The `@fulltext` directive will also add an `artistSearch` field on the root
query object to the generated subgraph GraphQL API, which can be used as
follows:

```graphql
{
  artistSearch(text: "breaks & electro & detroit") {
    id
    name
    bio
  }
}
```

For more information about the supported operators (like the `&` in the above
query), please refer to the [Postgres
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/textsearch.html).

### Feature: 3Box Profiles (#1574)

[3Box](https://3box.io) has become a popular solution for integrating user
profiles into dApps. Starting with this release, it is possible to fetch profile
data for Ethereum addresses and DIDs. Example usage:

```ts
import { box } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'

let profile = box.profile("0xc8d807011058fcc0FB717dcd549b9ced09b53404")
if (profile !== null) {
  let name = profile.get("name")
  ...
}

let profileFromDid = box.profile(
  "id:3:bafyreia7db37k7epoc4qaifound6hk7swpwfkhudvdug4bgccjw6dh77ue"
)
...
```

### Feature: Arweave Transaction Data (#1574)

This release enables accessing [Arweave](https://arweave.org) transaction data
using Arweave transaction IDs:

```ts
import { arweave, json } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'

let data = arweave.transactionData(
  "W2czhcswOAe4TgL4Q8kHHqoZ1jbFBntUCrtamYX_rOU"
)

if (data !== null) {
  let data = json.fromBytes(data)
  ...
}

```

### Feature: Data Source Context (#1404 via #1537)

Data source contexts allow passing extra configuration when creating a data
source from a template. As an example, let's say a subgraph tracks exchanges
that are associated with a particular trading pair, which is included in the
`NewExchange` event. That information can be passed into the dynamically
created data source, like so:

```ts
import { DataSourceContext } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'
import { Exchange } from '../generated/templates'

export function handleNewExchange(event: NewExchange): void {
  let context = new DataSourceContext()
  context.setString('tradingPair', event.params.tradingPair)
  Exchange.createWithContext(event.params.exchange, context)
}
```

Inside a mapping of the Exchange template, the context can then be accessed
as follows:

```ts
import { dataSource } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'

...

let context = dataSource.context()
let tradingPair = context.getString('tradingPair')
```

There are setters and getters like `setString` and `getString` for all value
types to make working with data source contexts convenient.

### Feature: Error Handling for JSON Parsing (#1588 via #1578)

With contracts anchoring JSON data on IPFS on chain, there is no guarantee
that this data is actually valid JSON. Until now, failure to parse JSON in
subgraph mappings would fail the subgraph. This release adds a new
`json.try_fromBytes` host export that allows subgraph to gracefully handle
JSON parsing errors.

```ts
import { json } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'

export function handleSomeEvent(event: SomeEvent): void {
  // JSON data as bytes, e.g. retrieved from IPFS
  let data = ...

  // This returns a `Result<JSONValue, boolean>`, meaning that the error type is
  // just a boolean (true if there was an error, false if parsing succeeded).
  // The actual error message is logged automatically.
  let result = json.try_fromBytes(data)

  if (result.isOk) { // or !result.isError
    // Do something with the JSON value
    let value = result.value
    ...
  } else {
    // Handle the error
    let error = result.error
    ...
  }
}
```
